## Class for MPI Object Instantiation

## Create objects to distribute them over your cores. 
# E.g. 2 MPIrun objects can lead to 2x5 cores usage. 
# Therefore the user can choose which model object has to be prioritized in core usage.
# On the other hand, the choice to use another parallelization is made by creating objects of another class, currently placeholder.
